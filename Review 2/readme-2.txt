# Java Project Second

## 📚 Overview
This Java project simulates a **sensor-actuator system** using GUI components and incorporates:
- Dynamic sensor simulation (temperature, humidity)
- Actuator responses (air conditioner, heater, humidifier)
- Timer-based updates
- Modular architecture for extensibility

The application uses Java Swing for the user interface and includes robust error handling, data validation, and event-driven interactions.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Core Functionality**
- Simulates temperature and humidity sensors with dynamic readings.
- Actuators (Air Conditioner, Heater, Humidifier) respond to sensor values.
- Adjustable thresholds for actuators.

✅ **Error Handling and Robustness**
- Graceful handling of file operations (FileWriter).
- Input validation to prevent crashes from invalid entries.

✅ **Integration of Components**
- Interfaces (`Sensor`, `Actuator`) for modular design.
- Smooth interaction between GUI components and sensor logic.

✅ **Event Handling**
- Timer-driven updates.
- Event listeners to handle user interactions.

✅ **Data Validation**
- Validates numeric inputs for thresholds and sensor values.

✅ **Code Quality and Innovation**
- Modular code design.
- Uses interfaces for abstraction.
- Potential for adding graphs or logging in the future.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. **Compile the code**
   ```bash
   javac src/Javaprojectsecond.java

	2.	Run the application

java -cp src Javaprojectsecond


	3.	Usage
	•	The application window will display real-time sensor data.
	•	Adjust thresholds or simulate sensor changes as needed.

⸻

🧪 Testing and Validation
	•	Run the app with various inputs to ensure correct actuator responses.
	•	Check file writing operations (if implemented) to ensure no crashes.
	•	Validate user inputs (e.g., non-numeric entries) to confirm proper error handling.

⸻

📌 Notes
	•	Uses Java Swing for GUI.
	•	Uses Java’s built-in Timer for scheduling updates.
	•	Compatible with Java 8+.
